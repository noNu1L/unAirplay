    # Host network is REQUIRED for:
    # - SSDP multicast discovery (239.255.255.250:1900)
    # - AirPlay device discovery via mDNS/Bonjour
    # - DLNA device advertisement to local network
    network_mode: host

    volumes:
      # Persist device configuration (DSP settings, etc.)
      - ./../:/app/
    environment:
      # Python unbuffered output for better logging
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

    # Optional: if you need local audio output (Server Speaker)
    # Uncomment the following to access host audio devices
    # devices:
    #   - /dev/snd:/dev/snd
    # group_add:
    #   - audio

# Note: Since network_mode: host is used, ports are not mapped here
# The application will use:
# - Port 6088: DLNA HTTP service
# - Port 6089: Web control panel
# - Port 1900/UDP: SSDP multicast (shared with other UPnP devices)
